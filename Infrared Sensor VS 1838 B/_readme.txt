1838B Infrared IR receiver

The 1838B is a miniaturised infrared receiver for remote control and other 
applications requiring improved ambient light rejection. The separate PIN 
diode and pre-amplifier IC are assembled on a single leadframe. The epoxy 
package contains a special IR filter. This module has excellent performance 
even in disturbed ambient light applications and provides protection against 
uncontrolled.

The 1838B is a miniaturised infrared receiver for remote control and other 
applications requiring improved ambient light rejection. The separate PIN 
diode and pre-amplifier IC are assembled on a single leadframe. The epoxy 
package contains a special IR filter. This module has excellent performance 
even in disturbed ambient light applications and provides protection against 
uncontrolled output pulses. The reciver can be powered from a 3.3V or 5V 
supply and with just one data output pin allows it to be easily interfaced 
with many types of microcontrollers.

Features:

• Photo detector and preamplifier in one package . 
• Internal filter for PCM frequency. 
• Inner shield,good anti-interference ability. 
• High immunity against ambient light. 
• Improved shielding against electric field disturbance 
• 3.0V or 5.0V supply voltage; low power consumption. 
• TTL and CMOS compatibility. 
• Suitable transmission code: NEC code,RC5 code.
