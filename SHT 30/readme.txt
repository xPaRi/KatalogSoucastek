SHT30 Digital Output Temperature and Humidity Sensor Module IIC I2C Interface 3.3V GY-SHT30-D For Arduino
 
Product Features
The digital temperature and humidity sensor module uses the SHT30 chip, 
and the measurement data is factory corrected, linearized, and temperature compensated. 
With temperature and humidity alarm output and software and hardware reset function. 
Avoid use in volatile organic environments in order not to damage the device.
